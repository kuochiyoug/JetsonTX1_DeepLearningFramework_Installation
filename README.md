# JetsonTX1 Deep Learning Framework Installation Scripts
The useful shell scripts and details about how to install any kind of famous deep learning framework. In this Scripts, I sort up the information on the Internet and provide following famous deep learning framework installation guides:

- **Tensorflow 1.3.0**
- **Chainer**
- **Caffe**
- **MXNet**

Please read the following instruction to proceed the installations.

### General Installation for environment construction
Before we start to install our amazing deep learning framework, it is sad to tell you that original JetsonTX1 Kit is not installed with correct environment(L4T24.1 Ubuntu14.04 32bit). Therefore, we need to flash up our TX1 to make sure the system is ready for famous deep learning tools.

- ** Install JetsonTX1 L4T28.1 (Ubuntu 16.04 64bits ARM version) **
